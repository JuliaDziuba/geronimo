						<div id="PublicVsPrivate" class="not-displayed">
							MakersMoon offers makers business management tools including a database with records for works, venues, clients, and the interactions of these things. All of this data is accessed via the left panel. This is all private. It is only accessable by the maker that owns the data.<br /><br /> 

							Makers can expand their MakersMoon profile to share basic data with other makers. This can be done by configuring the <i>Maker Profile</i> available in the <i>MakersMoon</i> drop down on the header. <br /><br />

							Makers can also create a public profile accessable to anyone with an internet connection via options in the the <i>Site</i> section in the header.<br /><br />

						<a id="PublicWorksNotDisplayed_display" class="display_toggle" href="#PublicWorksNotDisplayed">I marked a work as public but it does not appear on my public site, why?</a>
						<div id="PublicWorksNotDisplayed" class="not-displayed">
							First confirm you have checked that you want a public site and that you want works public on the <i>Public Site</i> configuration page. If both of these have been checked confirm the work is categorized. The public site needs to know how to organize your work and does not display works that are uncategorized.

						<a id="IncludeCategoryOnPublic_display" class="display_toggle" href="#IncludeCategoryOnPublic">How do I include a category of works on my public site?</a>
						<div id="IncludeCategoryOnPublic" class="not-displayed">
							The categories of work included on your public site are automatically generated based on the works you have selected to include on your public site. Mark each of the works you'd like to share as public and the page for that category of works will appear! 
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a id="IncludeArtistStatement_display" class="display_toggle" href="#IncludeArtistStatement">Can I include an artist statement?</a>
						<div id="IncludeArtistStatement" class="not-displayed">
							Because artists can have several styles of work Makers' Moon allows for a different artist statement for each category of work. If an artist statement exists for a category and there is a public page for that category the statement is displayed at the bottom of the public page.<br /><br />

							To create or update the artist statement click the down arrow on the <i>Works</i> menu then select <i>Categories</i>. Once on the categories page click the down arrow of the category you wish to update.

						<a id="CreateParentCategory_display" class="display_toggle" href="#CreateParentCategory">How do I create a parent category of works?</a>
						<div id="CreateParentCategory" class="not-displayed">
							Markers' Moon supports parent and children categories of works. To create a parent category simply create the category and then create additional categories and mark your parent category as the parent.

					<li>
						<a id="IncludeCategoryOnPublic_display" class="display_toggle" href="#IncludeCategoryOnPublic">Why is a category missing from the parent drop down list?</a>
						<div id="IncludeCategoryOnPublic" class="not-displayed">
							If a category does not appear on the parent category drop down list (when creating or editing work categories) then it is a child. Makers' Moon does not support "grandchildren". If this was a mistake you can edit the category and remove its parent. It will then be available as a parent category.

				<div id="ArtistStatement" class="not-displayed">An artist statement is your voice when you cannot discuss your work with clients in person. Help others appreciate your work. Use this statement to discuss the technique, inspiration and anything else you'd like clients to appreciate. When you create a public site the artist statement associated with each category of work will be displayed on the public page. See the FAQ section for more detail.</div>
